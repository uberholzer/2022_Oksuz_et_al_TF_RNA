## Contents
1.	**rna_curvefit.ipynb** - A notebook for fitting protein-RNA binding isotherms from fluorescence anisotropy data. Fits the fraction of bound RNA as a function of protein concentration at constant RNA concentration.  

2.	**curvefit_stats.ipynb** - A notebook for fitting protein-RNA binding isotherms from fluorescence anisotropy data for two samples, then conducting a two-tail Student's t-test for equivalence between the Kds.
